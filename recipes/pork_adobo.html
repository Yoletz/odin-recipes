  <p>
    The word Adobo was derived from the Spanish word “adobar”. 
    It means to marinate. This can be in the form of a liquid 
    marinade or to rub using a combination of powdered ingredient.
    This version of Filipino Adobo suggests marinating the pork 
    in soy sauce and crushed garlic. By preference, vinegar can 
    also be added as a marinade ingredient.
